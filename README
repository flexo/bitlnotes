A plugin which add the ability to store notes against users in bitlbee.

Currently not complete; bitlbee doesn't yet have the hooks required, and this code isn't complete either :)


Example session:

* Users on &bitlbee: @Flexo +nick @root 
<Flexo> notes nick list
<root> No notes set for nick.
<Flexo> notes nick add likes chocolate
<root> Added note for nick.
<Flexo> note nick add also likes tea
<root> Added note for nick.
<Flexo> notes nick list
<root> Your notes for nick:
<root> 0. likes chocolate
<root> 1. also likes tea
<Flexo> notes nick del 1
<root> Deleted note 1 for nick.
